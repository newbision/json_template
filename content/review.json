It has the ability to create perfect 1:1 copies of DVD movies. It can also compress commercial films to fit onto smaller blank discs as well as combine multiple DVD movies onto a single Blu-ray disc. It does all this and more with a degree of ease and quality that is simply unmatched by any other DVD copy software we reviewed.</p>",

                "section": "<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"add_large_popper\" src=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/324-dvd-cloner7.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin:10px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;\" />This DVD copy software operates in two separate modules: Express and Expert. Express is meant as a one-click option that allows you to duplicate a DVD movie without having to hassle with the technical details of the burn. All you need to do is load the disc you want to copy into your optical drive and click the Start button. Within half an hour you will have a copy of that disc that will work in any DVD player. The simplicity of this mode is one of DVD Cloner&rsquo;s defining characteristics and arguably its most compelling selling point.</p>\r\n<p>Expert mode is where DVD Cloner allows you to fine-tune your copy by offering several different options. For example, most commercial movie discs won&rsquo;t fit onto the average blank DVD. To solve this problem you can select the DVD-9 to DVD-5 copy option, which compresses the content found on a commercial disc and burns it onto the blank disc with less storage capacity. This option is not a 1:1 copy, but the copy is still high quality. If you spring for the more expensive DVD-9 (or DVD-DL) discs, this DVD copy software also has the ability to make an exact copy of any commercial disc you are likely to have on your shelf.</p>\r\n<p>There is also the scenario where you don&rsquo;t have a DVD-9 but you also don&rsquo;t want to compress your copy. DVD Cloner has the ability to split the larger commercial discs onto two separate smaller discs. This way you can retain all the quality and features of your commercial discs without having to spring for the more expensive dual-layer blank discs.</p>\r\n<p>This DVD copy software also allows you to customize what content you want to copy from disc to disc. For example, if you just want to copy the main movie from a DVD and eschew things like special features, trailers and menus, all you have to do is select the movie-only option from the Expert mode menu. This will strip all the extras away and give you just the main movie on the disc. This option is also the default setting in Express mode.</p>\r\n<p>The Movie Customized Copy option in Expert mode allows you to pick and choose precisely what content you want to transfer to a new disc. So if you want the movie plus the trailers but not the special features, you just select those features from the menu and burn them to a new disc. You can mix and match the content and create any new disc you would like.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: right; margin:10px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;\" src=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/324-dvd-cloner15.jpg\" class=\"add_large_popper\" alt=\"\" />This DVD copy software also allows you to burn disc image files onto a new disc. For example, if you have backed up the ISO file of a disc onto your hard drive and the original disc was lost or damaged, all you would need to do is put a new blank disc in your optical drive, select the Copy DVD Movie From Hard Disk option, select the ISO file you wish to burn and press Start. It&rsquo;s a very simple process that doesn&rsquo;t require you to have the original disc.</p>\r\n<p>A new feature in this iteration of DVD Cloner is the ability to combine multiple DVD movies onto a single Blu-ray disc. For example, you have a series of movies on DVD that you want to watch in a binge marathon, but you don&rsquo;t want to hassle with changing the disc out every two hours. Simply burn the movies onto a single Blu-ray disc and you&rsquo;ll have a single disc that you can watch all your movies on without interruption.</p>\r\n<p>Almost all the DVDs that you will want to back up will have some form of copy protection or encryption.  DVD Cloner has the ability to bypass all CSS encryptions and region codes. However, the About screen of the software clearly states that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law to make illegal copes of any copyrighted material, and you are on your own in dealing with any legal issue [sic]. You have been warned!!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This DVD copy software comes bundled with two other free applications. They are Stream Cloner Lite and Open DVD Ripper 3 Lite. The former allows you to capture streaming content from the internet and save it onto your computer. The latter enables you to rip movies off DVDs and convert them into a format that is playable on your computer. These applications are useful but don&rsquo;t provide the same diverse feature sets that are found in their non-lite counterparts.</p>"
